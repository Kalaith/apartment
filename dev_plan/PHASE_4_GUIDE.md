## Success Metrics for Phase 4
- [ ] Every dollar spent feels like a strategic choice.
- [ ] Players plan their building "character" (e.g., "Student Housing" vs. "Luxury Suites").
- [ ] Losing a tenant feels like losing a character, not just a revenue stream.
- [ ] New players can reach the first "Multi-Building" milestone without feeling lost.
